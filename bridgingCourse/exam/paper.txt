Hi everyone,

Very simple instructions

Step 1) In list.c, complete as many of the undefined functions as you can (the specification for those functions can be found in list.h)

Step 2) In list_main.c, write tests for what you've completed through use of asserts. You may use print statements to debug, but print statements aren't testing

Step 3) Submit your work on the CSE machines with "give cs1911 bridging"
